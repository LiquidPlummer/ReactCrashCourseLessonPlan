# Installation

## Node.js and npm
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which comes with npm.

Make sure to include the "Add to PATH" option in installer.
  
In a terminal window use the following commands to test if node and npm are installed:  
`npm -v`   
`node -v`  

## create-react-app
Next we will create a react app which will set up all the boilerplate react stuff. This will seet up a project including preform the init step and installing several react modules, including: react, react-dom, and react-scripts. Navigate to the location where you want to store your app, and type:  
`npx create-react-app "app-name"`
