# JSX
JSX stands for JavaScript XML and it allows you to write what looks like HTML inside of your JS code in React. Think of it as a convenient way of conceptualizing what your view will look like without having to leave your JS file.  
  
JSX in React is case sensitive, in that if an element is capitalized it is considered by React to be a component. HTML elements should be lowercase.
